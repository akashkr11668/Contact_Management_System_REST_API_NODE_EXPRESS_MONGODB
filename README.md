# Contact_Management_System_REST_API_NODE_EXPRESS_MONGODB

This is a secure and user-friendly REST API CRUD project, built using the popular technologies of Express, Node, and MongoDB. With our API, users can easily register an account with their unique username, email, and password, which is securely stored in our Mongoose schema. We use the latest bcrypt hashing methods to ensure that all user passwords are protected.

Once a user is registered and logged in with their email and password, they will receive a JSON web token, which is required for all subsequent CRUD operations. This token adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can manage their contacts and personal information.

This API allows users to easily manage their contacts without fear of unauthorized access. All information is securely stored and encrypted, and only the user has access to their personal information. Whether you need to add, update, or delete a contact, our API is designed to make it simple and secure.
